            This dish is composed of a great variety of ingredients cooked in abundant amounts of water: different types of “greens” (kale, savoy cabbage, “tronchuda”, etc), rice, potatoes (yes, we love our carbs), beans, turnips, carrots, 
            sausages (“chouriço”, “farinheira”, “moura”, etc), other types of meat (usually, pork) and sometimes with added bits of chicken.
